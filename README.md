## Overview

The goal of this project was to solve the coding challenges provided in the final assignment. The solutions demonstrate algorithmic problem-solving skills and the use of object-oriented programming.

**Key Objectives:**
- Develop efficient and well-structured code.
- Solve the provided problems using clean and reusable functions.
- Write documentation and comments for better code readability.

---

## Features

- Implementation of multiple functionalities depending on input files.
- Modular code with reusable functions and clear logic.
- Error handling for input validation.
- Output matching the requirements provided in the assignment.

---

## Files Included

- **`my_record.py`**: Contains the main code for reading input files, processing data, and producing outputs.
- **`results.txt`**: Example input file containing test results data.
- **`datasets.txt`**: Example input file containing dataset metadata.
- **`algorithms.txt`**: Example input file specifying algorithm details.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **IDE**: [e.g., PyCharm, VSCode]
- **Libraries**: None (the script uses only built-in Python modules like `os` and `sys`).

## How to Run

1. **Obtain the program files**:
   - Option 1: Clone the repository using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ChamodiMadara/Final-Coding-Challenge.git
     cd Final-Coding-Challenge
     ```
   - Option 2: Manually download `my_record.py` and the input files (`results.txt`, `datasets.txt`, `algorithms.txt`).

2. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   python my_record.py
   ```
   
### Provide input files:

- Ensure the following input files are in the same directory as `my_record.py`:
  - `results.txt`: Contains test results data.
  - `datasets.txt`: Contains metadata about datasets.
  - `algorithms.txt`: Specifies algorithms applied for data processing.

### Output:

- The program processes the input files and generates the output as specified in the assi---
